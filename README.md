# GT-DENT
GT-DENT is a Dental Patient Records App which came to be as a help for my parents' dental office.

## Features
- Reduce paper waste by transfering records to a digital platform
- Checks for repeated patients
- Dental specific format
- Smart Save to prevent exiting without saving changes
- Search patient by name or phone number
- Manually make backups to the cloud
- Print out prescriptions

## Possible Improvements
- Make the app fully customizable for anyone to use
- Automate the installation of the app (database, app, etc..)
- Allow the deletion of records (currently affects the database)
- Improve the visuals of the app in general
